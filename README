OpenGL in C++

The program can be created using the Makefile file, which is stored in the bin directory.
When the make command is executed, an executable file called main is created in the bin directory.

The program represents the basic functionality of the OpenGL library for C++.
It currently uses one scene and renders 9 objects (4 spheres, 4 trees, and one Suzie monkey) on that scene.
The program also implements two lights, one to illuminate the spheres, and the other to illuminate Suzie the monkey.
For control, a basic camera is implemented, controlled by WSAD keys.
